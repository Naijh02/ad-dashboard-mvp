# 📊 Advertising Dashboard MVP

This is a minimal advertising campaign dashboard built in ~3 hours using **React**, **Replit**, and **ChatGPT**.

## ✅ Features

- 🔐 Mock Login (email/password)
- 🖼 Upload ad banner (image preview)
- 🎯 Audience targeting
  - Age range (18–50)
  - Location
  - Interests (Tech, Fashion, Fitness, etc.)
- 📬 Campaign submission (simulated backend)
- 📋 Campaign list with:
  - Name
  - Date
  - Status
  - Targeting info
  - Simulated impressions & CTR
- 🧠 Optional: AI-generated ad copy field (manually or with OpenAI)
- I've done a manual ad copy field. We can also do it using OpenAI to generate different types of comments.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- React + React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS (optional, add if you want styling)
- AI: ChatGPT (for generating all code and structure)
- Deployed on Replit

## 🤖 How AI Helped

I used **ChatGPT** to:
- Generate the entire React application structure
- Implement logic for storing and displaying campaigns
- Simulate analytics (CTR, impressions)
- Speed up development from ~6–8 hours to 3 hours

Optional AI tools like Canva or DALL·E were used for mock banners.
